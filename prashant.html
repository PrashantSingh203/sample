<h2><CENTER>Welcome to Jolly Boy's Diary, where the passion for anime is as intense as a final Kamehameha!</CENTER><br>

<li>Please note the following before diving into these rankings:<br></li>

<li>Purely Subjective and Personal: Every ranking, review, and opinion expressed in this diary is entirely subjective and based on the personal tastes, preferences, and occasional fever dreams of "Jolly Boy." This is a diary, not a peer-reviewed academic journal.</li><br>

<li>Not Definitive or Universal: These rankings are not meant to be a definitive or objective list of the "best" anime ever made. Anime is an art form, and what one person loves, another might not (and thatâ€™s okay!). Your favorite show might be ranked lower than you think it should be, or a show you dislike might be highly praised.</li><br>

<li>Potential for Spoilers: While efforts will be made to minimize major plot giveaways, discussing why certain anime rank highly may inherently involve mentioning story elements. Read at your own risk of encountering minor, or in rare cases, major spoilers.</li><br>

<li>Argument Encouraged, Toxicity Isn't: Feel free to disagree, comment, and passionately defend your own top picks! Healthy debate is welcome, but all discussion should remain respectful and free of personal attacks or toxic behavior. We're all here for the love of the craft.</li><br>

<li>Rankings are Fluid: Anime is constantly evolving, and so are tastes! Future entries in the diary may see rankings shift as "Jolly Boy" discovers new masterpieces or re-evaluates old classics.</li><br>

In short: Take these rankings with a grain of salt, a sense of humor. Enjoy the journey!</ul>
